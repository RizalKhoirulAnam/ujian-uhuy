Now known as Lake Vostok, this huge body of water is located under the ice block that comprises Antarctica. The lake is able to exist in its unfrozen State beneath this block of ice because its waters are warmed by geothermal heat from the earth’s core. The thick glacier above Lake Vostok actually insulates it from the frigid temperatures (the lowest ever recorded on Earth) on the surface.\n\nThe lake was first discovered in the 1970s while a research team was conducting an aerial survey of the area. Radio waves from the survey equipment penetrated the ice and revealed a body of water of indeterminate size. It was not until much more recently that data collected by satellite made scientists aware of the tremendous size of the lake; the satellite-borne radar detected an extremely flat region where the ice remains level because it is floating on the water of the lake.\n\nThe discovery of such a huge freshwater lake trapped under Antarctica is of interest to the scientific community because of the potential that the lake contains ancient microbes that have survived for thousands upon thousands of years, unaffected by factors such as nuclear fallout and elevated ultraviolet light that have affected organisms in more exposed areas. The downside of the discovery, however, lies in the difficulty of conducting research on the lake in such a harsh climate and in the problems associated with obtaining uncontaminated samples from the lake without actually exposing the lake to contamination.

England did not supply the colonies with coins and it did not allow the colonies to make their own coins, except for the Massachusetts Bay Colony, which received permission for a short period in 1652 to make several kinds of silver coins. England wanted to keep money out of America as a means of controlling trade: America was forced to trade only with England if it did not have the money to buy products from other countries. The result during this prerevolutionary period was that the colonists used various goods in place of money: beaver pelts, Indian wampum, and tobacco leaves were all commonly used substitutes for money. The colonists also made use of any foreign coins they could obtain. Dutch, Spanish, French, and English coins were all in use in the American colonies.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, funds were needed to finance the war, so each of the individual States and the Continental Congress issued paper money. So much of this paper money was printed that, by the end of the war, almost no one would accept it. As a result trade in goods and the use of foreign coins still flourished during this period.\n\nBy the time the Revolutionary War had been won by the American colonists, the monetary system was in a State of total disarray. To remedy this situation, the new Constitution of the United States, approved in 1789, allowed Congress to issue money. The individual States could no longer have their own money supply. A few years later, the Coinage Act of 1792 made the dollar the official currency of the United States and put the country on a bimetallic Standard. In this bimetallic system, both gold and silver were legal money, and the rate of exchange of silver to gold was fixed by the government at sixteen to one.", question: "The passage mainly discusses:", options: ["American money from past to present", "the English monetary policies in colonial America", "the effect of the Revolution on American money", "the American monetary system of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries"], answer: 3 },

In addition to studying the skies, Halley was also deeply interested in exploring the unknown depths of the oceans. One of his lesser-known accomplishments that was quite remarkable was his design for a diving bell that facilitated exploration of the watery depths.\n\nThe diving bell that Halley designed had a major advantage over the diving bells that were in use prior to his. Earlier diving bells could only make use of the air contained within the bell itself, so divers had to surface when the air inside the bell ran low. Halley's bell was an improvement in that its design allowed for an additional supply of fresh air that enabled a crew of divers to remain underwater for several hours.\n\nThe diving contraption that Halley designed was in the shape of a bell that measured three feet across the top and five feet across the bottom and could hold several divers comfortably; it was open at the bottom so that divers could swim in and out at will. The bell was built of wood, which was first heavily tarred to make it water repellent and was then covered with a half-ton sheet of lead to make the bell heavy enough to sink in water. The bell shape held air inside for the divers to breathe as the bell sank to the bottom.\n\nThe air inside the bell was not the only source of air for the divers to breathe, and it was this improvement that made Halley’s bell superior to its predecessors. In addition to the air already in the bell, air was also supplied to the divers from a lead barrel that was lowered to the ocean floor close to the bell itself. Air flowed through a leather pipe from the lead barrel on the ocean floor to the bell. The diver could breath the air from a position inside the bell, or he could move around outside the bell wearing a diving suit that consisted of a lead bell-shaped helmet with a glass viewing window and a leather body suit, with a leather pipe carrying fresh air from the diving bell to the helmet.", question: "The subject of the preceding passage was most likely Halley's:", options: ["childhood", "work as an astronomer", "many different interests", "invention of the diving bell"], answer: 1 },

A fictional logger of incredible strength, he was most likely based on an actual nineteenth-century logger from the northern United States or Canada. As a folk hero, he struck a chord with Americans on some level, perhaps because he was, incredibly strong but also because he was hard-working and capable, ingenious in solving problems, and fun-loving.\n\nThough there is evidence that Paul Bunyan tales were part of oral tradition in the nineteenth century, Paul Bunyan stories did not appear in written form until the early twentieth century. Journalist James McGillivray included descriptions of Bunyan in a series of essays entitled “The Round River Drive,\" which appeared in a number of Midwestern newspapers between 1906 and 1910. However, it was through an extensive advertising campaign that Paul Bunyan moved solidly into print.\n\nRecognizing the appeal of Paul Bunyan as a figure for his company’s advertising, William Laughead, an advertising executive for the Red River Lumber Company, initiated a campaign that consisted of a series of publications featuring Paul Bunyan. For several decades, the company distributed these publications free of charge and made no attempt to obtain a Copyright on them. In fact, the company vigorously encouraged other writers to make use of Paul Bunyan because it felt that the use of this character enhanced the name recognition of the Red River Lumber Company inasmuch as the name of the folk hero and the name of the company had become interwoven.\n\nThe Bunyan stories published by Red River and further circulated by others were tall tales of gigantic proportions. In these tales, Bunyan is depicted as a man of superhuman proportions, who is strong, hard-working, entrepreneurial, and innovative. In one story, for example, Paul is credited with digging the Great Lakes in order to create a watering hole for his giant ox, Babe. In another of these tales, Paul caused an entire winter of blue snow to fail by swearing a blue streak after he injured himself by smashing his thumb with a large hammer. A third story in the series describes Paul’s role in establishing the Mississippi River.\n\nFascination with Paul Bunyan has continued to grow, and today he is a Standard of American folklore. The prevalence of Bunyan as a figure of folklore today is evidenced by references to him in countless stories, cartoons, poems, and songs as well as the numerous community festivals and logging competitions featuring Paul Bunyan that can be found throughout the sections of the country where logging has a strong tradition.", question: "The purpose of this passage is to:", options: ["present the actual feats of a real-life logger", "discuss a 'larger than life' folk hero", "describe logging in North America", "provide an overview of American folktales"], answer: 1 },
